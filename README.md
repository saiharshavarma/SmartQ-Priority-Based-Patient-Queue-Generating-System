## SOLUTION

Our proposed solution involves the implementation of a comprehensive scheduling system that utilizes a voicebot to facilitate patient calls. 
- This system is designed to analyze and extract keywords from patient concerns. 
- Based on the severity of the issue, the voicebot will provide appropriate suggestions to the patient and schedule a consultation slot with a doctor based on Priority Scheduling Algorithm .
- Additionally, a brief report detailing the patient's concerns and scheduled appointment will be forwarded to the doctor. 
- This will ensure that the doctor is adequately briefed about the issue before the appointment, thereby enabling them to provide optimal care/

## CURRENT STATE OF DEVELOPMENT
- All the modules including the voice to text AI based system, criticality evaluator, department allocator and priority based appointment scheduler have been completed with backend and frontend integration.
- We are using a freely available API for creating summary for the patient. 
- It currently supports single language.
- We have synthesized our own data set for criticality evaluator & department allocator.
- All the points that were mentioned earlier during the goals have been successfully implemented.
- As we are using incremental model so the baseline of the product has been developed and more features would be added in the future.

## REVENUE MODEL
- The application can be served to various hospitals on a contract basis
- It will be like software as a service SAAS
- The charges varies from hospital to hospital based on number of doctors in the hospital, daily patient traffic, region, and number of departments
- Deployment charges depending on whether hospitals want their patient to have website as a service or phone number as a service


## FUTURE ADVANCEMENTS
- As we are using incremental model and have developed the baseline of our product and we  would be adding more layers to it for improvements.
- As we will gather revenue gradually we will use paid APIs for better voice recognition
- In the future we will also be implementing the phone call feature as we earn revenue
- We will be using better machine learning models as we will get access to private databases of hospitals once the NDA contract is signed with them for a petter recall and precision.
- We will also be providing multi lingual support using paid APIs 
- We will be getting access to better quality data by crowdsourcing techniques


## FUTURE SCOPES
The proposed solution has a vast scope for future development and improvement. 
Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHRs): 
- The solution can be integrated with EHRs, allowing doctors to access patients' medical histories and test results before the appointment. This will enable doctors to provide better care and make more informed decisions. 
- Expansion of services: The solution can be expanded to include other healthcare services, such as pharmacy and laboratory services. This will enable patients to get 
all their healthcare needs addressed in one place. 
- Integration with wearable technology: The solution can be integrated with wearable technology, such as fitness trackers and health monitors, to provide doctors with real-time health data. This will enable doctors to provide personalized care and make more informed decisions. 
- Expansion to other geographies: The solution can be expanded to other geographies, enabling patients in remote areas to access quality healthcare services. This will help improve the overall health of the population and reduce healthcare disparities.
